    <h2 class="section-title">About Jennifer Nickell, MS, RD</h2>
    <p>I’m a Registered Dietitian and educator specializing in the mind–body–metabolism connection. After two decades in clinical pediatrics and family nutrition, I now help adults and parents understand how thoughts, hormones, and environment shape metabolic health. My work is rooted in neuroscience, adult learning theory, and compassionate behavior change.</p>
    <p>I practice through <strong>Nourish</strong>, a nationwide virtual platform where sessions are covered by most insurance providers. We won’t chase perfection—we’ll build small routines that fit your life, so food becomes a portal for growth: mental, physical, and relational.</p>
