    <h1>Philosophy — Metabolism as Communication</h1>
    <p>Metabolism isn’t just chemistry. It’s relationship—between your thoughts, your meals, your hormones, and your environment. When you change the story, you change the signal. When you shift the environment, your choices get easier. This is where physiology and meaning meet.</p>
    <h2>Three Lenses</h2>
    <h3>Mind</h3>
    <p>Attention and expectation shape physiology. We practice nervous-system literacy and motivational interviewing to reduce threat and build safety so your body can adapt.</p>
    <h3>Body</h3>
    <p>Hormones, blood sugar, sleep, and movement drive how you feel. We use gentle nutrition and skill-building to support stability without perfectionism.</p>
    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <p>Your routines, pantry, and social context are the scaffolding for change. Small design tweaks make the aligned choice the easy choice.</p>
    <h2>What This Looks Like in Care</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Short experiments, clear feedback loops</li>
      <li>Skills you can practice this week</li>
      <li>Weight-inclusive, trauma-informed care</li>
    </ul>
